# 1. Fetch shipment data from Google Docs

- We cannot use data from our shipment providers and internal documents for
  security reasons we need to maintain a data source with public information
  about our shipments.
- [Notion.so has no public API, yet](https://www.notion.so/Does-Notion-have-an-API-I-can-use-4541b07a5caa46dba0026624646118c0).
- Therefore we use a public Google Drive Spreadsheet
